## Solana Workbench
![](https://github.com/workbenchapp/solana-workbench-releases/raw/main/solworkbench.png?s=200)
Solana Workbench is your one stop shop for local Solana development.

Deploy local validators, airdrop tokens, and more with its GUI on OSX and Windows.
Solana development may be like chewing glass today, but weâ€™re on a mission to change
that forever.

## Deps

If you already have Node on your system (we recommend version 17), you can
install the Node deps like so:

```
$ npm install --legacy-peer-deps && \
    (cd ./release/app/ && npm install --legacy-peer-deps) && \
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

In order to use Anchor functionality, the `anchor` CLI must be
installed. To connect to a local test validator, you can either
run one yourself on the CLI, or use the Docker functionality via
the app.

Detailed instructions:
