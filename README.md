Solana Workbench is your one stop shop for local Solana development.

Deploy local validators, airdrop tokens, and more with its GUI on OSX and Windows.
Solana development may be like chewing glass today, but weâ€™re on a mission to change
that forever.

## Build dependencies

If you already have Node on your system (we recommend version 17), you can
install the Node deps like so:

```
$ npm install
```

In order to use Anchor functionality, the `anchor` CLI must be
installed. To connect to a local test validator, you can either
run one yourself on the CLI, or use the Docker functionality via
the app.

Detailed instructions:

>> NOTE: use `bin/setup.sh` for both Linux and OSX (but don't forget to add XCode cmdline tools for OSX) - it basically does the following

- [Nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash`
- Node (latest version): `nvm install 16.15.0` and `nvm use 16.15.0`
- Docker: `curl -o- https://get.docker.com | bash`
- Yarn: `corepack enable`
- Anchor CLI must be available in PATH to use Anchor stuff
  - from https://book.anchor-lang.com/chapter_2/installation.html
  - `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
  - `source $HOME/.cargo/env`
  - `sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.9.9/install)"`
  - `cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor avm --locked --force`
  - `avm use latest` -- needed on Linux (needs `libudev-dev`)
  - Be sure to add `$HOME/.avm/bin` to your PATH to be able to run the installed binaries

### Linux

to build the rust based tools (`solana` and `anchor` cli's), you will also need to install some native build tools and libraries. (See the Dockerfile for more)

- Docker Desktop, or a working configured Docker setup


```
sudo apt-get install -yq curl libudev-dev git build-essential libssl-dev pkg-config
```

### OSX

- XCode Command Line Tools (if on OSX)
- on OSX some path stuffing around, so solana and anchor binaries are in the path (for development)
- Docker Desktop, or a working configured Docker setup
- Add anchor and solana to your path (edit `~/.zshenv` if you're using `zsh`):

```
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"

path+=("$HOME/.avm/bin")
path+=("$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin")

. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"

export PATH
```

### Windows (native)

without anchor tooling for now

- [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
- Node (latest version): `nvm install 16.15.0`
- as Administrator `nvm use 16.15.0`
- Yarn: `corepack enable`
- `npm install`
- Docker Desktop, or a working configured Docker setup


## Run

to run:

```
$ npm run dev
```

Now you're working with Workbench!

## Development

The project is currently in a migratory phase from Bootstrap to Tailwind. Do not write new code using Bootstrap layouting. Instead, opt for using Tailwind's
atomic CSS system instead. The goal is to eventually be able to fully remove bootstrap from the codebase.

## Building A Release

On each platform (OSX, Windows, Linux), run:

```
git clone https://github.com/workbenchapp/solana-workbench new-release-dir
cd new-release-dir
npm install
npm run package
```

To sign and notarize the OSX artifacts:

1. You must have the correct certificates from developer.apple.com installed on the build computer.
2. Signing will occur automatically during `npm run package`.
3. Notarization requires three environment variables to be set:
    1. `APPLE_NOTARIZATION=1` -- Indicate that the builds should be notarized
    2. `APPLE_ID` -- The email address associated with the developer Apple account
    3. `APPLE_ID_PASS` -- The [app specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397) for the app. This is different from the Apple ID's main password and set in the developer portal.

>> TODO: Add the signing steps for Windows.

Then upload binaries and `latest*.yml` files to the Github release.
